PLCopen TC6
===========
   
    PLCopen is a vendor- and product-independent worldwide association defining
    international standards for various topics related to control programming.
    For this purpose, PLCopen has 6 technical committees.
   
   
    The goal of the sixth committee (TC6) is to define a standard file format, 
    based on XML, for exchanging programmables controllers programmed using 
    IEC 61131-3 languages. Beremiz uses this file format for saving the PLC
    programs of projects.
